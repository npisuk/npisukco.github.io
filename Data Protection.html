							<h3>2. About the personal information we use</h3>
<p>We use personal information on different groups of individuals including:
<ul>
	<li>healthcare professionals</li>
	<li>patients</li>
	<li>staff</li>
	<li>contractors</li>
	<li>suppliers</li>
	<li>complainants, enquirers</li>
	<li>survey respondents</li>
	<li>professional experts and consultants</li>
	
							</ul>
The personal information we use includes information that identifies you like your name, address,
date of birth and postcode. 

<br>We also use more sensitive types of personal information, including information about racial or ethnic origin, genetic or health data.
<br>The information we use can relate to personal and family details; education, training and employment details; lifestyle and social circumstances; goods and services; visual images; details held in the patient record; responses to surveys.
							<br>
							<br><h3>3. Our purposes for using personal information</h3>

The NPIS and UKTIS are tasked to provide comprehensive and integrated poisons and teratology information services in the UK.
							
<br>Services provided by the NPIS and UKTIS include: national telephone enquiry lines available to healthcare professionals in the UK and the Republic of Ireland as well as members of the public from the Republic of Ireland, and a range of online resources:

							<ul>
								<li>TOXBASE online available to healthcare professionals only</li>
<li>TOXBASE app</li>
<li>UKTIS*</li>
<li>TOXlearning e-learning resource</li>
<li>individual unit web sites</li>
							</ul>	
								
We use personal information to enable us to provide healthcare services; audit; surveillance; research; supporting and managing our employees; and maintaining our accounts and records.
							
<br>* excluding ‘BUMPS’ for which a separate privacy policy is available at
<a href="http://www.medicinesinpregnancy.org">www.medicinesinpregnancy.org</a>
<br>							
							<br><h3>4. Our legal basis for using personal information</h3>
The NPIS and UKTIS consider that performance of our tasks and functions are in the public interest. So when using personal information our legal basis is usually that its use is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, or in the exercise of official authority vested in us. In some situations we may rely on a different legal basis; for example, when we are using personal information to pay a supplier, our legal basis is that its use is necessary for the
purposes of our legitimate interests as a buyer of goods and services.
							
<br>When we are using more sensitive types of personal information, including health information, our legal basis is usually that the use is necessary:
							<ul>
<li>for the provision of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and services; or</li>
<li>for reasons of public interest in the area of public health; or</li>
<li>for reasons of substantial public interest for aims that are proportionate and respect people's rights, for example research; or</li>
<li>in order to protect the vital interests of an individual; or</li>
<li>for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or in the case of a court order</li>
							</ul>
<br>
							<h3>5. Who provides the personal information</h3>
When you do not provide information directly to us, we receive it from other individuals and organisations involved in the delivery of health and care services in the UK and Republic of Ireland. These include other NHS organisations and primary care contractors such as GPs, dentists, pharmacists and opticians; other public bodies, e.g. Local Authorities and suppliers of goods and
services.

<br>							
							<br><h3>6. Sharing personal information with others</h3>
Depending on the situation, where necessary we will share appropriate, relevant and
proportionate personal information in compliance with the law, with the following:
<br><ul>
							<li>healthcare professionals
	<li>patients and their chosen representatives or carers</li>
<li>staff</li>
<li>healthcare social and welfare organisations</li>
<li>suppliers</li>
<li>service providers</li>
<li>legal representatives</li>
<li>auditors and audit bodies</li>
<li>research organisations</li>
<li>people making an enquiry or complaint</li>
								
							</ul>
							<br>
							<h3>7. Transferring personal information abroad</h3>
No personal information is transferred abroad.

							<br>
							<br><h3>8. Retention periods of the information we hold</h3>
							<b>NPIS Birmingham, NPIS Cardiff, NPIS Newcastle (including UKTIS)</b>
<br><a href="Download/records-management-cop-hsc-2016.pdf" style="color: blue">The Records Management Code of Practice for Health and Social Care 2016</a> sets out what people working with or in NHS organisations in England, and in the Cardiff and Vale Local Health Board, need to do to manage records correctly. It's based on current legal requirements and professional best practice and was published on 20 July 2016 by the Information Governance Alliance (IGA).
	<br>						
							
							<br><b>NPIS Edinburgh</b>
<br>Within NHS Lothian we keep personal information as set out in the Scottish Government Records Management: NHS Code of Practice (Scotland) Version 2.1 January 2012. The NHS Code of Practice sets out minimum retention periods for information, including personal information, held in different types of records including personal health records and administrative records. As directed by the Scottish Government in the <a href="https://www.nhslothian.scot/YourRights/DataProtection/Documents/Records%20Management%20Policy.pdf" style="color: blue">Records Management Code of Practice</a>, we maintain a retention schedule as part of our Records Management Policy detailing the minimum retention period for the information and procedures for the safe disposal of personal information.
<br>
							<br><h3>9. How we protect personal information</h3>
We take care to ensure your personal information is only accessible to authorised people. Our staff has a legal and contractual duty to keep personal health information secure, and confidential.
							<br>
<br>The following security measures are in place to protect personal information:

							<ul>
								<li>all staff undertake mandatory training in Data Protection and IT Security</li>
<li>compliance with NHS Information Security Policies</li>
<li>organisational policy and procedures on the safe handling of personal information</li>
<li>access controls and audits of electronic systems</li>
								
							</ul>

							<h3>11. Your rights</h3>
This section contains a description of your data protection rights:
							<br>
							<br><b>The right to be informed</b>
<br>The NPIS and UKTIS must explain how we use your personal information. We use a number of ways to communicate how personal information is used, including:
							<ul>
								<li>this Data Protection Notice</li>
								<li>discussions with our service users</li>
							</ul>
							<br><b>The right of access</b>
<br>You have the right to access your own personal information. This right includes making you aware of what information we hold along with the opportunity to satisfy you that we are using your information fairly and legally.
You have the right to obtain:
							<ul>
								<li>confirmation that your personal information is being held or used by us</li>
								<li>access to your personal information</li>
								<li>additional information about how we use your personal information</li>
							</ul>
Although we must provide this information free of charge, if your request is considered unfounded or excessive, or if you request the same information more than once, we may charge a reasonable fee.
<br>If you would like to access your personal information, you can do this by submitting a written request via:
							<br>
<br>National Poisons Information Service (NPIS Edinburgh)
<br>Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh
<br>51 Little France Crescent
<br>Edinburgh
<br>EH16 4SA
							<br>

<br>Once we have received your request and you have provided us with enough information for us to locate your personal information, we will respond to your request without delay, within one month (30 days). However If your request is complex we may take longer, by up to two months, to respond. If this is the case we will tell you and explain the reason for the delay.
							<br>
							<br><b>The right to rectification</b>
							
<br>If the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete you have the right to have this corrected.
<br>If it is agreed that your personal information is inaccurate or incomplete we will aim to amend your records accordingly, normally within one month, or within two months where the request is complex. However, we will contact you as quickly as possible to explain this further if the need to extend our timescales applies to your request. Unless there is a risk to patient safety, we can restrict access to your records to ensure that the inaccurate or incomplete information is not used
until amended.
							
<br>If for any reason we have shared your information with anyone else, perhaps during a referral to another service for example, we will notify them of the changes required so that we can ensure their records are accurate.
							
<br>If on consideration of your request the NPIS or UKTIS does not consider the personal information to be inaccurate then we may add a comment to your record stating your concerns about the information. If this is the case we will contact you within one month to explain our reasons for this.
							
<br>If you are unhappy about how the NPIS or UKTIS has responded to your request for rectification we will provide you with information on how you can complain to the Information Commissioner's Office, or how to take legal action.
							<br>
							<br><b>The right to object</b>
<br>When the NPIS or UKTIS is processing your personal information for the purpose of the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority you have the right to object to the processing and also seek that further processing of your personal information is restricted. Provided the NPIS or UKTIS can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for processing your personal information, for instance; patient safety or for evidence to
support legal claims, your right will not be upheld.
